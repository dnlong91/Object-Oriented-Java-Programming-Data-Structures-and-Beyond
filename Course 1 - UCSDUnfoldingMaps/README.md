# Object Oriented Programming in Java

- This directory contains all of my assignments from the Coursera Course: [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java?specialization=java-object-oriented)

- The project I have completed during this course is called UCSDUnfoldingMaps with the starter code provide by the instructors from UC San Diego

- The starter code of the project can be found at https://github.com/cjalvarado/Course1StarterCode

unfolding_app_template and UC San Diego/Coursera MOOC starter code
==================================================================

This is a skeleton to use Unfolding in Eclipse as well as some starter
code for the Object Oriented Programming in Java course offered by 
UC San Diego through Coursera.

A very basic Unfolding demo you'll find in the source folder in the default package. 
For more examples visit http://unfoldingmaps.org, or download the template with
examples.

The module folders contain the starter code for the programming assignments
associated with the MOOC.

Get excited and make things!
